# Project7
Here, I created some new functions that were continuously needed and applied basic steps like dropping unnecessary columns, handling missing and null values, and removing outliers from the data. Then, started to apply some feature engineering methods like label and one hot encoding and handle negative values in our data. After that, we used some math equations to calculate important parameters to be used in the next parts. Finally, we applied some built-in libraries related to predictive data analytics and machine learning libraries in Python such as using some of the feature selection methods as well as doing some testing on different models, and applying ML Pipeline on the final model.
